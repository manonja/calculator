## Project overview

### JavaScript Calculator
#### User Story
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/.

1/ I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

2/ I can clear the input field with a clear button.

3/ I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

#### How?
By creating a HTML structure, styling it with CSS and make it work using JavaScript.


### Code

Files:
 *  `index.html` file
The html file creates the structure of the calculator. It directly connects the button with
the onClick method.
* `style.css`
Styling file.
 *  `index.js` file
I created four functions. Each function runs according to a specific button hit.

## How to run the program
